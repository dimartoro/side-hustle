## Description:
Side Hustle is a full-stack application that connects individuals needing temporary assistance with those eager to provide it and earn some extra money. This innovative platform helps authenticated users post, view, and bid on gigs quickly and confidently.


Finding reliable, trustworthy help or work is easy with Side Hustle. Whether you're a student looking for a quick gig to help pay your bills or a homeowner needing extra hands to complete a project, Side Hustle has you covered. By connecting you with like-minded individuals in your community, Side Hustle makes it easy to find the help you need when you need it.


As an authenticated user, you can quickly and easily post a gig on the platform, detailing the specific help you need. Alternatively, if you're looking to earn some extra cash, you can browse through a wide range of gigs and place a bid on the ones that interest you.


Side Hustle requires authentication for all users, ensuring a safe and secure platform for those hiring and those for hire.
